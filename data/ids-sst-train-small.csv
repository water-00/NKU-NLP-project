3174	98da5ed9dac2249879a999b40	 It 's excessively quirky and a little underconfident in its delivery , but otherwise this is the best ` old neighborhood ' project since Christopher Walken kinda romanced Cyndi Lauper in The Opportunists .	3
3175	5ce314c911fe85d1ba018a479	 The film oozes craft .	3
3176	f729123d7c699ea136d30d2af	 Robinson 's web of suspense matches the page-turning frenzy that Clancy creates .	4

3193	b71ca0b0e53724b4d31135b44	 A different and emotionally reserved type of survival story -- a film less about refracting all of World War II through the specific conditions of one man , and more about that man lost in its midst .	3
3194	d0756c73f461b062c320dfc3b	 It 's sweet , funny , charming , and completely delightful .	4
3195	2fd910d3d9ae43cc166096709	 A perfectly competent and often imaginative film that lacks what little Lilo & Stitch had in spades -- charisma .	2
3196	781f351be27c8dbb17860f9ee	 Beautifully shot against the frozen winter landscapes of Grenoble and Geneva , the film unfolds with all the mounting tension of an expert thriller , until the tragedy beneath it all gradually reveals itself .	4
